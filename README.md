## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- APIs: Netflix API for content, Authentication API for user management

## Design

The design of the Netflix Clone project follows a client-server architecture. The client-side is developed using React for building the user interface. The server-side is built using Node.js and Express to handle API requests, user authentication, and data management.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Browse and search for movies and shows
- Display movie/show details, including trailers and descriptions
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Recommendations based on user's watch history
- User profile management

## Challenges Faced

- **API Integration**: Integrating the Netflix API for content delivery posed challenges in handling data responses and ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes required careful design and testing.

- **Authentication**: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization to protect user data and ensure a safe experience.

## Additional Add-ons

- **Watchlist**: Added a feature that allows users to create a watchlist of content they want to watch later.

- **Dark Mode**: Implemented a dark mode option for improved user experience in low-light conditions.

- **Continue Watching**: Enabled users to resume watching content from where they left off.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend and backend folders separately and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. In the backend folder, set up environment variables for API keys and configurations.
4. Run `npm start` in both frontend and backend folders to start the development servers.

## Conclusion

The Netflix Clone project showcases the integration of APIs for content delivery and user authentication. It demonstrates key features of a streaming platform while addressing challenges related to API integration, responsive design, and user authentication. The additional add-ons enhance the user experience and provide a solid foundation for further development.
